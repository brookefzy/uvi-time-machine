1. Crop the Pedestrian Images Based on Bounding Boxes:
2. Use a Pretrained Model for Clothing Feature Extraction:
Once you have cropped images of pedestrians, the next step is to use a pretrained model to extract features related to dressing styles. Here are two common approaches:

Fashion Recognition Models: Use fashion recognition models pretrained on large fashion datasets to extract clothing types, textures, and colors from the cropped pedestrian images.
DeepFashion Model: A deep learning model trained on the DeepFashion dataset, which is designed for fashion recognition and clothing attribute prediction.
FashionNet: A model trained to identify clothing categories and predict clothing attributes such as sleeve length, color, and pattern.
Code Example (Using a pretrained model like ResNet for feature extraction):
```from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import img_to_array, load_img
from tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input

model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)  # Feature extraction model

def extract_features(image_path):
    img = load_img(image_path, target_size=(224, 224))
    img_array = img_to_array(img)
    img_array = preprocess_input(img_array)
    img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
    features = model.predict(img_array)
    return features

features = extract_features("cropped_pedestrian_1.jpg")```

3. Classify Clothing Attributes:
If you want to classify specific clothing attributes such as color, texture, clothing type (e.g., jackets, skirts, pants), you can use a pretrained model fine-tuned for this purpose. Some available models for this include:

* DeepFashion Category and Attribute Prediction: This model can predict clothing attributes like sleeve length, clothing type, color, and texture.
* Attribute Recognition (PAR Models): Many pedestrian attribute recognition models include clothing-related attributes.
Pretrained Model Example (DeepFashion):

You can use an existing framework like FashionNet (https://github.com/xoraus/FashionNet), which can output clothing attributes.
Fine-tune an image classification model (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) to predict attributes based on a labeled fashion dataset.

4. Perform Clustering to Find Dressing Styles:
After extracting features, you can cluster these features to find distinct dressing styles. This can help you identify different types of street styles based on pedestrians' clothing.

Use a clustering algorithm like K-Means, DBSCAN, or Agglomerative Clustering to group similar dressing styles.
The feature vectors extracted from the pretrained models will serve as input to these clustering algorithms.
